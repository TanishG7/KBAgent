Hi All, This is to inform you that we have handled displaying of system messages in Desktop Lead Manager Business Objective: To provide contextual and informational messages to the users to improve UX. Existing Implementation: Currently, the Lead Manager / Message Center ecosystem is built as a platform for communication between two parties, where both of them exchange messages. However, there was no provision of displaying messages outside of the purview of these two parties, which we are terming as System Messages or Admin Messages. These messages will be helpful for notifying users of certain scenarios which are beyond the purview of the two communicating users in a conversation. New Implementation: We have now handled System Messages to be displayed Center-Aligned in a conversation with just a timestamp and background color of yellowish tone to diﬀerentiate it from normal chat messages. The handling has been done on the basis of identiﬁcation of message_ref_type = "SYSTEM" in the Conversation API. Sharing below some screenshots of some processes for which System Messages will be triggered. Some of these processes are in the development / testing phase for example: PaywithIM. As and when other processes scale up or use this system, our handling will make sure that the UX remains the same for various types of System Messages. Screenshots: (Order Expiry System Message) (Buyer Requirement Closure System Message) (PayWithIndiaMART System Message) For more details & understanding the technical background, please refer: [MPLaunch@IM] [LMSHelp@IM] Provision of inserting Admin / System messages in LMS now available from LMS Backend QA Team is requested to test this launch and give their valuable feedback. Notes for Testing: Test this launch on the New UI of Desktop Lead Manager, live for 100% Paid Users. Check for diﬀerent screen resolutions. Check for any UI distortions.
